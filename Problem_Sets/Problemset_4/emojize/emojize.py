    Summary: 
        Because emoji aren’t quite as easy to type as text, at least on laptops and desktops, 
        some programs support “codes,” whereby you can type, for instance, 
        :thumbs_up:, which will be automatically converted to 👍. 
        Some programs additionally support aliases, whereby you can more succinctly type, 
        for instance, :thumbsup:, which will also be automatically converted to 👍.

        See carpedm20.github.io/emoji/all.html?enableList=enable_list_alias for a list of codes with aliases.

        In a file called emojize.py, implement a program 
        that prompts the user for a str in English 
        and then outputs the “emojized” version of that str, 
        converting any codes (or aliases) therein to their corresponding emoji.
