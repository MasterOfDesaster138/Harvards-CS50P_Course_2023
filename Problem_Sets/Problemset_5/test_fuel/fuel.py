    Title: Problemset_3 - Fuel Gauge

    Summary: 
            Fuel gauges indicate, often with fractions, just how much fuel is in a tank. 
            For instance 1/4 indicates that a tank is 25% full, 
            1/2 indicates that a tank is 50% full, 
            and 3/4 indicates that a tank is 75% full.

            In a file called fuel.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a fraction, 
            formatted as X/Y, wherein each of X and Y is an integer, 
            and then outputs, as a percentage rounded to the nearest integer, 
            how much fuel is in the tank. 
            If, though, 1% or less remains, output E instead to indicate that the tank is essentially empty. 
            And if 99% or more remains, output F instead to indicate that the tank is essentially full.

            If, though, X or Y is not an integer, 
            X is greater than Y, or Y is 0, 
            instead prompt the user again. 
            (It is not necessary for Y to be 4.) 
            Be sure to catch any exceptions like ValueError or ZeroDivisionError.
