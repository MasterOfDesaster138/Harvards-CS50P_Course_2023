##### HOW TO TEST #####

"""Hereâ€™s how to test your code manually:

Run your program with python response.py.
Ensure your program prompts you for an email, 
then type malan@harvard.edu, followed by Enter. 
Your program should output Valid.

Run your program with python response.py. 
Type your own email, followed by Enter. 
Your program should output Valid.

Run your program with python response.py. 
Type malan@@@harvard.edu, followed by Enter.
Your program should output Invalid.

Run your program with python response.py. 
Mistype your own email, including an extra . before .com, for example. 
Press enter and your program should output Invalid.

You can execute the below to check your code using check50, 
a program that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. 
But be sure to test it yourself as well!
