    Summary:
    Best to use your “indoor voice” sometimes, writing entirely in lowercase.

    In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input 
    and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. 
    You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.
"""

print(input('What should be converted to indoor voice?: ').lower())


""" Testing:
Run your program with python indoor.py. Type HELLO and press Enter. Your program should output hello.
Run your program with python indoor.py. Type THIS IS CS50 and press Enter. Your program should output this is cs50.
Run your program with python indoor.py. Type 50 and press Enter. Your program should output 50.
